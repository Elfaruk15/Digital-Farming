            <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>
                    Digital farming, also known as smart farming or precision agriculture, 
                    refers to the integration of advanced technologies like sensors, software, robotics, 
                    and data analytics into the agricultural sector. 
                    This technological shift aims to improve crop yields, 
                    reduce waste, and increase efficiency in food production. By leveraging digital tools, 
                    farmers can make more informed decisions, streamline operations, 
                    and contribute to sustainable agricultural practices.

        <h1>Key Component of Digital Farming</h1>
                <div class="image-box">
                    <img src="images/agric2.jpeg" alt="2" width="500">
                </div>

            <div class="text-box">
                <h1>Key Component</h1>
                <p>
                    1. Precision Agriculture:
                    <br>
   Precision agriculture involves the use of GPS technology, drones, and sensors to monitor crop conditions at a micro level. This allows farmers to apply fertilizers, pesticides, and water precisely where and when they are needed, reducing wastage and environmental impact. By tailoring care to specific areas, precision farming optimizes inputs and maximizes yields.
<br>	
2. IoT and Sensors in Agriculture:
<br>
   The Internet of Things (IoT) has made it possible to connect a network of devices to gather real-time data from the field. Sensors embedded in soil or installed on machinery provide detailed information about soil moisture, temperature, and crop health. This data is then used to make timely interventions, such as automated irrigation or pest control.
<br>
3. Drones and Aerial Imaging:
<br>
   Drones equipped with cameras and sensors can cover large areas of farmland, capturing high-resolution images that help detect issues like pest infestations, disease outbreaks, or nutrient deficiencies. Aerial imaging also provides farmers with a comprehensive view of their fields, making it easier to manage large areas effectively.
<br>
4. Farm Management Software (FMS):
<br>
   Farm Management Software enables farmers to centralize data from multiple sources and manage various aspects of their farm operations, such as crop planning, inventory management, and financial tracking. By analyzing this data, farmers can optimize planting schedules, resource allocation, and labor management.
<br>
5. Data Analytics and AI:
<br>
   Data collected from digital tools is analyzed using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms. These systems can predict weather patterns, assess crop performance, and offer insights on the best times to plant, irrigate, and harvest. This helps in reducing uncertainty and increasing profitability.
<br>
6. Autonomous Machinery:
<br>
   Autonomous tractors and harvesters, controlled remotely or equipped with AI, are becoming increasingly common. These machines can operate without human intervention, performing tasks like planting, weeding, and harvesting with precision. They help reduce labor costs and allow farms to operate 24/7, even in adverse weather conditions.
<br>
7. Blockchain in Agriculture:
<br>
   Blockchain technology is being used to ensure traceability and transparency in the agricultural supply chain. By using a decentralized ledger, all parties involved in the production and distribution of food can access real-time data on the journey of produce from farm to table. This increases consumer trust and reduces fraud.
<br>
8. Robotics in Farming:
<br>
   Robots are being developed to perform tasks such as planting, weeding, pruning, and even picking delicate crops like fruits. These machines help address labor shortages, reduce human error, and increase efficiency, especially in repetitive or precision tasks.
